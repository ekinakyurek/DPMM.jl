      title = {Low Rank Updates for the Cholesky Decomposition},
      author = {Seeger, Matthias},
      year = {2004},
      abstract = {Usage of the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula to update  linear systems after low rank modifications of the system  matrix is widespread in machine learning. However, it is  well known that this formula can lead to serious  instabilities in the presence of roundoff error. If the  system matrix is symmetric positive definite, it is almost  always possible to use a representation based on the  Cholesky decomposition which renders the same results (in  exact arithmetic) at the same or less operational cost, but  typically is much more numerically stable. In this note, we  show how the Cholesky decomposition can be updated to  incorporate low rank additions or downdated for low rank  subtractions. We also discuss a special case of an  indefinite update of rank two. The methods discussed here  are well-known in the numerical mathematics literature, and  code for most of them can be found in the LINPACK suite.},
